Lecturer: Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning Coordinator: Rhodes AI Research Group (RAIRG), Rhodes University, South Africa

(046) 603 7447

Research Interest
====
- Big data analytics
- Signal processing
- Artificial Intelligence
- Radio Interferometry/Astronomical Techniques



Supervision
======
I work closely with the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO or SKA SA) based in Cape Town and  I am part of Rhodes Centre for Radio Astronomy Techniques & Technologies based in the Department of Physics and Electronics, Rhodes University.  I am coordinating the Rhodes AI Research Group (RAIRG) based in the Department of mathematics. My research interests are in big data analysis, signal processing, artificial intelligence, radio interferometry / astronomical techniques. Send me a cover letter in which you explain why you would like to work with me for your honors, masters, doctorate, or post-doctorate. Also include academic transcripts in the request for supervision. Click [here](https://www.ru.ac.za/mathematics/research/artificialintelligenceresearchgroupairg/) for more details.
