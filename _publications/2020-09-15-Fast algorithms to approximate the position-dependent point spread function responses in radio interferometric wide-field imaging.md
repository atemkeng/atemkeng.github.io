title: "Xova: Baseline-Dependent Time and Channel Averaging for Radio Interferometry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-27-Xova
excerpt: 'Xova is a software package that implements baseline-dependent time and channel averaging on Measurement Set data. The uv-samples along a baseline track are aggregated into a bin until a specified decorrelation tolerance is exceeded. The degree of decorrelation in the bin correspondingly determines the amount of channel and timeslot averaging that is suitable for samples in the bin. This necessarily implies that the number of channels and timeslots varies per bin and the output data loses the rectilinear input shape of the input data.'
